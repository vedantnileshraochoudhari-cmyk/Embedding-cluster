# Embeddings Clustering Project

This project demonstrates:
1. Mock embeddings for 100 short sentences
2. KMeans clustering (k=3)
3. PCA 2D visualization with cluster representatives
4. Semantic search helper function

## Observations from clustering:
- Cluster 0 → likely short/neutral sentences
- Cluster 1 → product/news type sentences
- Cluster 2 → longer/descriptive sentences
