# 🧠 Embeddings Clustering Project

This project performs sentence embedding analysis and semantic clustering using:
- Mock embeddings for 100 sentences
- KMeans clustering (k=3)
- PCA reduction and 2D visual plot
- Representative sentence identification
- Semantic search function

## 🔍 Observations from clustering:
- Cluster 0: Short factual statements
- Cluster 1: Task/procedure or productivity-type sentences
- Cluster 2: Longer descriptive and narrative-style sentences

## 📦 Output files produced:
- plot.png (2D PCA visualization)
- labels.json
- representatives.json

## ✔ Status:
All tasks from Day 1–Day 7 completed successfully.
